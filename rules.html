  <h1>So you wanna be a card shark?</h1>
  <p>There are many kinds of poker but 5-Card Draw is usually the beginner's choice. In my simplified version of this game, you and an ai opponent are dealt 5 cards each. The goal of the game is to make the best combination of these 5 cards, also known as a hand, but we'll get into those later. You have the ability to select any of your cards to swap out for new cards in the deck. After your selection the ai will show its hand and compare to see who is the winner. The strategy of the game is to keep a part of your hand that may be valuable and try to trade out the other cards for a more valuable hand. </p>
<h1>The Deck</h1>
<p>The traditional card deck is made of 52 cards of 4 suits: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs. The suits have a hierarchy of value and have been listed as such. Spades are better than Hearts, etc. Along with the suits, the cards have a hierarchy of value with the obvious ones being the numbered cards that range from 2-10. Keep in mind that the worth of a cards number is more than the suit. The 'face cards' also have implicit values based on their order. Jacks-11, Queen-12, King-13. The Ace is tricky because it has the highest value of 14, but can also be used as a 1 in certain situations.</p>
<h1>The Hands</h1>
<p>There are 10 classified hands in poker with each one having many variations of worth. We'll be going one by one from the least valuable hand to the most. <br> High Card - When no player has any combination and simply tests who has the most valuable single card. The numbers all trump lesser numbers but also consider the suit values. A King of Spades trumps a King of Clubs but is still worth less than the Ace of clubs. <br> One pair - Simply two cards matching, follows the same hierarchy of suit and number. <br> Two pair - This is when you have 2 seperate pairs of cards. A pair of 3's and pair of 4's for example. The highest pair determines the winner. <br> Three of a kind - 3 of the same card. <br>Straight - This is when your 5 cards all align in order. The value of the straight is determined. </p>
